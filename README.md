# Mercury Engine

## Project Goals
- Create a game engine in Rust which compiles to multiple platforms.  To start - x86_64, wasm, and Gameboy Advance.  After that, add support for N64.
- As a demo, create a town that the character can move through and interact with.
- Once all of the above is done, implement a basic story engine.
